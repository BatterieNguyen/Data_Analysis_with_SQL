__Preparing for Pratice__
- There are two dataset used - legislators and legislator_term
- The solutions, questions and content in this file are mainly referenced from the book "SQL for Data Analysis Advanced Techniques for Transforming Data into Insight"
- The syntax in this file is mainly written in SQL Server format.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. COHORTS - A USEFUL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
* __Cohort__
  * A group of individuals who share some characteristic of interest
  * Important to consider the ethical implications of cohorting entities without their awareness

* __Cohort Analysis__
  * Framework for detecting correlations between cohort characteristics and these long-term trends => lead to hypotheses about the causal driver.
  * Monitor new cohorts of users or customers and assess how they compare to previous cohorts
  * Three components - Corhort grouping, Time series, and Aggregate metric
  * Four types - Retention, Survivorship, Returnship (repeating purchase behavior), and Cumulative behavior

### 1.1. Components of Cohort Analysis
* __Cohort Grouping__ // Cohort Definition
  - based on a starting date.
  - formed around characteristics that are innate or changing over time.
  - 
* __Time Series__
 
* __Aggregate Metric__

### 1.2. Types of Cohort Analysis


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. RETENTION

### 2.1. Basic Retention Curve
Calculate the percentage of cohort retained in the whole population
* __Self JOIN__
```
SELECT	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, b.term_start) AS period,
	a.id_bioguide, a.first_term, b.term_start
FROM	(
	SELECT	id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
	FROM	legislator_terms
	GROUP BY	id_bioguide
	)	a
	INNER JOIN legislator_terms b ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
WHERE	a.id_bioguide = 'T000275'
-- GROUP BY	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, b.term_start);
ORDER BY	 period ASC, id_bioguide ASC;
```
=> find how long a legislator retain calculating from the first term which is minimum of term_start.
```
SELECT	period,
		FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period) AS cohort_size,
		cohort_retained,
		cohort_retained*1.0/ FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period)	AS pct_retained
FROM	(
		SELECT	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, FORMAT(b.term_start, 'yyyy-01-01')) AS period,
				COUNT(DISTINCT a.id_bioguide) AS cohort_retained
		FROM	(
				SELECT	id_bioguide, FORMAT(MIN(term_start), 'yyyy-01-01') AS first_term
				FROM	legislator_terms
				GROUP BY	id_bioguide
				)	a
				INNER JOIN legislator_terms b ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
		GROUP BY	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, FORMAT(b.term_start, 'yyyy-01-01'))
		) aa
ORDER BY 1;
```
* __Pivoting__ => `CASE WHEN`
```
SELECT	cohort_size,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 0 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr0,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 1 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr1,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 2 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr2,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 3 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr3,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 4 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr4
FROM	(
	SELECT	period,
		FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period) AS cohort_size,
		cohort_retained,
		cohort_retained*1.0/FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period) AS pct_retained
	FROM	(
		SELECT	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, b.term_start) AS period,
			COUNT(DISTINCT a.id_bioguide) AS cohort_retained
		FROM	(
			SELECT	id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
			FROM	legislator_terms
			GROUP BY	id_bioguide
			) a 
			INNER JOIN	legislator_terms b ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
			GROUP BY	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, b.term_start)
			) aa
	) aaa
GROUP BY	cohort_size;
```

### 2.2. Adjusting Time Series to Increase Retention Accuracy
- The first step is to create a data set that contains a record for each Dec 31th that each legislator was in the office.
```
SELECT	a.id_bioguide, a.first_term, 
		b.term_start, b.term_end,
		c.date,
		DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, c.date) AS period
FROM	(
		SELECT	id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
		FROM	legislator_terms
		GROUP BY id_bioguide
		) a
		INNER JOIN	legislator_terms b	ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
		LEFT JOIN	date_dim c			ON c.date	BETWEEN	b.term_start AND b.term_end
													AND c.month_name = 'December' AND c.day_of_month = 31
;
```
___=> within a particular year, those legislators who are retained would be counted, and in the next year, it would be re-calculated.___

- The second is to calculate the cohort_retained for each period
```
SELECT	period,
		COUNT(DISTINCT id_bioguide) AS cohort_retained
FROM	(
		SELECT	a.id_bioguide, a.first_term, 
				b.term_start, b.term_end,
				c.date,
				COALESCE(DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, c.date), 0)  AS period
		FROM	(
				SELECT	id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
				FROM	legislator_terms
				GROUP BY id_bioguide
				) a
				INNER JOIN	legislator_terms b	ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
				LEFT JOIN	date_dim c			ON c.date	BETWEEN	b.term_start AND b.term_end
															AND c.month_name = 'December' AND c.day_of_month = 31
		) aa
GROUP BY	period
ORDER BY	1;
```
___=> For those whose terms are ended up under a year (date and period columns have null), it is calculated as 0 (`COALESCE(column_name, 0)`).___

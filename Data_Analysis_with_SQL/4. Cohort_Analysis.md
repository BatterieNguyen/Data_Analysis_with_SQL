__Preparing for Pratice__
- There are two dataset used - legislators and legislator_term
- The solutions, questions and content in this file are mainly referenced from the book "SQL for Data Analysis Advanced Techniques for Transforming Data into Insight"
- The syntax in this file is mainly written in SQL Server format.

## 1. COHORTS - A USEFUL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
* __Cohort__
  * A group of individuals who share some characteristic of interest
  * Important to consider the ethical implications of cohorting entities without their awareness

* __Cohort Analysis__
  * Framework for detecting correlations between cohort characteristics and these long-term trends => lead to hypotheses about the causal driver.
  * Monitor new cohorts of users or customers and assess how they compare to previous cohorts
  * Three components - Corhort grouping, Time series, and Aggregate metric
  * Four types - Retention, Survivorship, Returnship (repeating purchase behavior), and Cumulative behavior

### 1.1. Components of Cohort Analysis
* __Cohort Grouping__ // Cohort Definition
  - based on a starting date.
  - formed around characteristics that are innate or changing over time.
  - 
* __Time Series__
 
* __Aggregate Metric__

### 1.2. Types of Cohort Analysis


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. RETENTION

### Basic Retention Curve
Calculate the percentage of cohort retained in the whole population
* __Self JOIN__
```
SELECT	period,
		FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period) AS cohort_size,
		cohort_retained,
		cohort_retained*1.0/ FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period)	AS pct_retained
FROM	(
		SELECT	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, FORMAT(b.term_start, 'yyyy-01-01')) AS period,
				COUNT(DISTINCT a.id_bioguide) AS cohort_retained
		FROM	(
				SELECT	id_bioguide, FORMAT(MIN(term_start), 'yyyy-01-01') AS first_term
				FROM	legislator_terms
				GROUP BY	id_bioguide
				)	a
				INNER JOIN legislator_terms b ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide
		GROUP BY	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, FORMAT(b.term_start, 'yyyy-01-01'))
		) aa
ORDER BY 1;
```
* __Pivoting__ => `CASE WHEN`
```
SELECT	cohort_size,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 0 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr0,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 1 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr1,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 2 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr2,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 3 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr3,
	MAX(CASE WHEN period = 4 THEN pct_retained END) AS yr4
FROM	(
	SELECT	period,
		FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period) AS cohort_size,
		cohort_retained,
		cohort_retained*1.0/FIRST_VALUE(cohort_retained) OVER (ORDER BY period) AS pct_retained
	FROM	(
		SELECT	DATEDIFF(year, a.first_term, b.term_start) AS period,
			COUNT(DISTINCT a.id_bioguide) AS cohort_retained
		FROM	(
			SELECT	id_bioguide, MIN(term_start) AS first_term
			FROM	legislator_terms
			GROUP BY	id_bioguide
			) a 
			INNER JOIN	legislator_terms b ON a.id_bioguide = b.id_bioguide

			) aa
	) aaa
GROUP BY	cohort_size;

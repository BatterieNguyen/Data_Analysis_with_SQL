__A/B testing__ (also known as split testing)
- A statistical experiment used to compare two or more variations of a webpage, advertisement, email, or other elements of a marketing campaign.
- It is commonly employed in digital marketing and user experience (UX) research to determine which version of a design or content leads to better performance or user engagement.

__The process of A/B testing__ 
- involves splitting a target audience into two or more groups and exposing each group to different variations of the element being tested.
- The control group is typically shown the original or existing version (referred to as "A"), while the other groups are shown different variations (often referred to as "B," "C," and so on).
- The groups are randomly assigned to ensure a fair comparison.

__Key steps involved in A/B testing are as follows:__
- __Hypothesis formulation__ - Clearly define the objective of the test and formulate a hypothesis regarding the expected impact of the variations on the desired outcome.
- __Variable selection__ Identify the specific element or feature of the design or content that you want to test.
  > This could include headlines, call-to-action buttons, layouts, color schemes, or any other element that may impact user behavior or performance.
- __Test setup__ - Randomly divide your target audience into control and variation groups.
  > - The control group receives the existing version (A), while the variation groups receive the modified versions (B, C, etc.).
  > - Ensure that the sample sizes for each group are statistically significant to yield reliable results.
- __Data collection__ - Measure and collect data on user behavior, engagement, conversions, or any other relevant metrics for each variation.
  > This could involve tracking click-through rates, conversion rates, time spent on page, bounce rates, or other key performance indicators (KPIs).
- __Statistical analysis__ - Analyze the collected data using statistical methods to determine whether the variations have a significant impact on the desired outcome.
  > This typically involves comparing the performance metrics between the control group and the variation groups using statistical tests.
- __Conclusion__ - Based on the statistical analysis, draw conclusions about the performance of each variation and determine which variation, if any, outperforms the others.
  > Use the results to make informed decisions about which design or content variation to implement.
